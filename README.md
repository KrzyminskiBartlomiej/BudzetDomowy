## About
Application that allows to maintain your home finances.
For now it consists basic features like:

 - Creating user,
 - Adding outcome,
 - Adding cost category,
 - Showing already added costs,
 - Making juxtaposition.

Home Budget data is stored in MySQL Database, connection with this DB is created </br>
only while logging into application or exiting/logging off, which makes traffic </br>
with DB on low level.

Application is currently on alpha test phase which means there are couple </br>
amendments to do, like:

 - Upgrade user privileges in DB,
 - Secure category and outcome addition,
 - Upgrade application look,
 - Code refactor to meet MVC rules,
 - Amendments connected with number precision, limits etc.

Plans for next Home Budget releases:

 - Adding income,
 - Adding repeated incomes/outcomes (rent, salary),
 - More juxtapositions, month, week, etc.
 - More table views, month, week, specific etc.
 - Application for Android to improve cost gathering (also to make life easier),
 - Adding milestones like new TV, car etc.
 - Much more...

Current version: 1.00.0 alpha test
